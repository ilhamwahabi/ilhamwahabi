<h3 align="center">Hi! I'm Ilham :wave:</h3>

---

I'm a frontend developer based on Bandung, Indonesia. Currently I was student in Institut Teknologi Bandung with major of Informatics. I'm also a speaker with web development topics.

I often use React (and React Native) but also able to use Vue, Angular, Svelte, Flutter, etc. I'm always interested in learning new things especially if it's frontend technology.

- I love to develop eye-candy user interfaces
- Use Node.js if I need backend (since it still Javascript)
- Interested to explore Golang, Rust, Reason
- I think open source is COOL :star_struck:
- Started to aware with SEO, accessibility and performance :rocket:
- Hobby: play Yu-gi-oh and cooking :man_cook:
