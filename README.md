---

I'm a Frontend Developer based on Bandung, Indonesia. Currently I was student in Institut Teknologi Bandung with major of Informatics. I've also been a speaker several times with topics about web development.

I often use React (and React Native) but also able to use Vue, Angular, Svelte, Flutter, etc. I'm always interested in learning new things especially if it's frontend technology.

- I love to develop eye-candy user interfaces
- Use Node.js if I need backend (since it still Javascript)
- Interested to explore Golang, Rust, Reason
- I think open source is COOL
- Started to aware with accessibility and performance
- Hobby: cooking and play Yu-gi-oh
